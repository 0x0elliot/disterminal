# disterminal
<h1>Access your terminal using Discord.</h1>
<p>Use Disterminal to access your terminal using discord. So no matter what device you're on,<br>
You can easily access your command-line and do the work you want to. Disterminal is still in it's pre-pre alpha phase<br>
And I heavily encourage any community support towards it. I can't do this alone trust me guys. It's<br>
a fun project but seriously, I code like shit, You can see how shitty I wrote this. I need help.
</p>

<h2>I am open-sourcing my code and encouraging any help :)</h2>
<br>
<h2>Running Disterminal:</h2>


```
pip install discord.py
git clone https://github.com/0x0elliot/disterminal
cd disterminal
python3 disterminal.py
```


Now go to discord, To your selected channel.
To log into that PC, Leave this program running on it. Then go to the selected discord channel and type:

```
!username
!password

#start passing your commands.
Log out
```


<h3>Things you require to do:</h3>
<p>1. Turn on developer's mode on discord<br>
2. Make a discord application, Turn it into a bot, Get the client Token from discord's developer portal.<br>
3. Modify the script accordingly. I have marked the comments where you need to modify.</p>

<h4>It can be seen as a proof of concept:</h4>
<p>While making this project, I had the best of intentions. I didn't want to hurt anyone and I just wanted a cool
Way to control my computer. I did get it in a way but I realised that in the process I made a really easy reverse-shell. Which anyone can set up under 5 minutes. I realized it myself a little late. So instead of shying away from it, We can see it as a proof of concept of the possibility of mallicious usage of discord's API. Literally all you need to do is to set the code up, Transfer it to any computer, Find a way to run it and you have got yourself a nice reverse-shell backdoor into that computer.</p>
<br>
<b>Pretty sure that it's against discord's TOS as well.</b>
<br>
<b>Disclaimer: I do not wish for my code to be assosiciated with any illegal practices or anything else like that. I wrote this to make lives easier. Though it isn't that good to help just yet. As I mentioned earlier, It hit me late how easily it can be used in a mallicious way when I had to set it up again. I HEREBY DECLARE THAT I WOULD NOT BE HELD IN CHARGE FOR ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES YOU COMMIT USING THIS OR A MODIFICATION OF THIS SO PLEASE BE RESPONSIBLE OUT THERE, HAVE FUN, FOLLOW THE LAW PEACE<3</b>
