<h1>Access your terminal using Discord.</h1>
<p>Use Disterminal to access your terminal using discord. So no matter what device you're on,<br>
You can easily access your command-line and do the work you want to. Disterminal is still in it's pre-pre alpha phase<br>
And I heavily encourage any community support towards it. I can't do this alone trust me guys. It's<br>
a fun project but seriously, I code like shit, You can see how shitty I wrote this. I need help.

<h2>I am open-sourcing my code and encouraging any help :)</h2>

<h2>Running Disterminal:</h2>

pip install discord.py
git clone https://github.com/kiddocoder/disterminal

<h3>Things you require to do:</h3>
<p>1. Turn on developer's mode on discord<br>
2. Make a discord application, Turn it into a bot, Get the client Token from discord's developer portal.<br>
3. Modify the script accordingly. I have marked the comments where you need to modify.</p>
